# Reports

ChoreoAtlas can emit validation results in HTML, JSON, and JUnit. Use them for developer feedback, CI gating, and dashboards.

## Quick usage

```bash
choreoatlas validate \
  --flow contracts/flows/order-flow.graph.flowspec.yaml \
  --trace traces/successful-order.trace.json \
  --report-format html --report-out reports/validation-report.html
```

Multiple outputs can be generated by running validate multiple times with different `--report-format` and `--report-out`.

## HTML report

- Purpose: human-friendly view with timeline, coverage, and gate summary.
- File: `reports/validation-report.html`
- Contains: overall status, per-step results, coverage bars, thresholds/baseline summary, edition badge (CE / Pro Standard / Pro Privacy).

Open the sample: `/docs/samples/validation-report.html`.

## JSON report

Use JSON for programmatic consumption.

```bash
choreoatlas validate \
  --flow contracts/flows/order-flow.graph.flowspec.yaml \
  --trace traces/successful-order.trace.json \
  --report-format json --report-out reports/validation.json
```

Example shape (abbreviated):

```json
{
  "flow": "contracts/flows/order-flow.graph.flowspec.yaml",
  "trace": "traces/successful-order.trace.json",
  "summary": { "status": "PASS", "steps": 4, "issues": 0 },
  "coverage": { "steps": 1.0, "conditions": 0.98 },
  "thresholds": { "steps": 0.9, "conditions": 0.95, "skipAsFail": false },
  "baseline": { "path": null, "mode": "none" },
  "steps": [
    { "name": "Create Order", "result": "PASS", "durationMs": 27 },
    { "name": "Charge", "result": "PASS", "durationMs": 18 }
  ],
  "gateResult": { "code": 0, "reason": "ok" }
}
```

## JUnit report

CI systems commonly parse JUnit XML for pass/fail summaries.

```bash
choreoatlas validate \
  --flow contracts/flows/order-flow.graph.flowspec.yaml \
  --trace traces/successful-order.trace.json \
  --report-format junit --report-out reports/validation.junit.xml
```

Mapping:

- Each orchestration step becomes a test case.
- Failures (including threshold/baseline violations) are represented as `<failure>` nodes.
- The process exit code differentiates validation failure vs. gate failure.

## GateResult and exit codes

Exit codes are designed for CI gates:

- `0` success
- `3` validation failed (trace vs. FlowSpec mismatch)
- `4` gate failed (thresholds or baseline not met)

The JSON report embeds a `gateResult` with `code` and `reason` to make CI decisions explicit.

## Tips

- Produce both HTML and JUnit in CI: HTML for manual inspection, JUnit for dashboards.
- Keep reports as build artifacts for 14â€“30 days.
- Use thresholds to prevent regressions; baselines to stabilize noise.
