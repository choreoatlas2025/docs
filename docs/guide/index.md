**Map, Verify, Steer cross-service choreography with contracts-as-code**

ChoreoAtlas CLI is a "contract-as-code" microservice orchestration governance platform that uses the **ServiceSpec + FlowSpec** dual contract system to generate executable contracts from real execution traces, validating service-level semantics and orchestration-level temporal relationships in CI/CD and runtime.

## üéØ Core Value

ChoreoAtlas implements a **dual contract architecture** that provides both service-level and orchestration-level validation:

- **ServiceSpec Contracts**: Define the "what" - preconditions, postconditions, and semantic rules for individual service operations
- **FlowSpec Contracts**: Define the "how" - step sequences, data flow, and choreography across multiple services

## Key Problems We Solve

### 1. The Documentation-Reality Gap
Traditional API documentation becomes stale quickly. ChoreoAtlas contracts are executable and validated against real traces, ensuring they stay current.

### 2. Microservice Integration Complexity  
As systems grow, understanding the relationships and dependencies between services becomes increasingly difficult. ChoreoAtlas provides a clear, verifiable map of service interactions.

### 3. Runtime Behavior Drift
Services evolve over time, sometimes breaking assumptions that other services depend on. ChoreoAtlas detects these drifts automatically.

### 4. Testing in Production Complexity
Contract validation works with real execution traces from production systems, enabling "testing in production" with confidence.
